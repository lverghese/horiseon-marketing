# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc

## Purpose
The purpose of Horiseon SSS is to educate business on the importance of the web, social media, and search engines in interactivity with potential audiences and customers. I refactored this website to work smoother with the user and to create a much more smoother experience when used. There was many bits of repetition that did not need to be added onto the CSS/HTML, a couple syntax fixes, and I added a flexbox to the header. It's not completely responsive to mobile devices yet but the basis is there if need be. I learned that refactoring code can actually be more difficult than you think and that a develop and feature branch are your best friends.
